Spring Boot CI/CD Pipeline



This repository demonstrates how to implement a complete CI/CD pipeline for a Spring Boot application, enabling robust, automated build, test, containerization, and deployment processes ideal for modern cloud or container environments.[1][2]

### Features

- **End-to-End CI/CD:** Automatically builds, tests, and deploys Spring Boot code with each push.
- **Containerization:** Application is packaged as a Docker image for consistent deployment.[2][1]
- **Static Code Analysis:** Optionally integrates tools like SonarQube for code quality.
- **Cloud Ready:** Can be adapted for deployment on Kubernetes, AWS, or other cloud infrastructure.
- **Infrastructure-as-Code:** Uses deployment manifests or scripts to automate infrastructure setup.

## Pipeline Overview

The CI/CD pipeline includes the following stages:[3][1][2]
1. **Build:** Uses Maven or Gradle to compile and package the application.
2. **Unit Testing:** Runs unit/integration tests automatically.
3. **Static Analysis:** (Optional) Runs SonarQube or other tools for code quality checks.
4. **Dockerization:** Builds Docker image for the app.
5. **Push to Registry:** Publishes the Docker image to DockerHub, AWS ECR, or similar.
6. **Deployment:** Deploys the new version to a cloud VM, Kubernetes, or other platform.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker (for container builds)
- Java (JDK 17+ recommended)
- Maven or Gradle
- Jenkins/GitHub Actions/Other CI tool
- Cloud Provider or Kubernetes cluster for deployment (optional)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Mohammed-Azam237/spring-boot-cicd-pipeline.git
   cd spring-boot-cicd-pipeline
   ```

2. **Build the application:**
   ```
   ./mvnw clean package
   ```

3. **Run locally (optional):**
   ```
   java -jar target/*.jar
   ```

4. **Build Docker image:**
   ```
   docker build -t your-username/spring-boot-app:latest .
   ```

5. **Push Docker image to registry:**
   ```
   docker push your-username/spring-boot-app:latest
   ```

6. **Deploy (Sample Kubernetes):**
   ```
   kubectl apply -f manifest/deployment.yml
   kubectl apply -f manifest/service.yml
   ```

## Customizing the Pipeline

- **Jenkins:** Update `Jenkinsfile` for custom stages and credentials.
- **GitHub Actions:** Edit `.github/workflows/*` for workflow customizations.[3]
- **Kubernetes:** Adjust YAML manifests in the `manifest/` directory.
